# Wells-Fargo_Hackathon
Files relevant to IITM's 2023 Shaastra's Wells Fargo Hackathon round 1.

The Dataset used was generated using python. A lot of changes were made for the data generated to be 
relevant to the hackathon and fit to use.This included oversampling for training via ADASYN, preprocessing etc.
The final datasets used for training and testing can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LePvQgVEgdIhXNXuxfBTsmWBtxiduprJ?usp=sharing.
The final .ipynb file which uses  sklearn's RandomForestClassifier is also present in the same folder, titled "cc-fraud-detection-proto.ipynb".
Theres also a file named EDA.ipynb which contains exploratory data analysis for the dataset.
Finally theres a jpeg file which has the classification report containing our models performance on various metrics.
